This pattern will repeat each time the sword changes targets.<a className='underline'>The Terraprisma is a guaranteed drop from the Empress of Light when all damage dealt to the boss occurs during the day.</a>

Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Terraprisma has over a Ruthless one is knockback.</h1>

Bee Arrows are unaffected by gravity and disperse upon impact with an enemy or solid block, spawning three small homing bee projectiles with three independent 1/3 (33.33%) chances to spawn an extra bee. The bee projectiles deal 1/3 (33.33%) of the weapon and ammos damage (9 base damage) before dissipating after a 10-second duration or upon contact with water or lava, and have a 1/2 (50%) chance to deal 1 extra damage.[1] Individual bees can pierce one enemy or ricochet off of blocks once, but never both simultaneously.<a className='underline'>The Bees Knees has a 1/3 (33.33%) chance of being dropped by the Queen Bee.</a>

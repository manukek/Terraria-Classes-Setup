The bees deal 100% of the weapons base damage (9 base damage) and have a 1/2 (50%) chance to deal 1 extra damage. Bee projectiles home in on their closest target and pierce enemies two times (hitting three times) before dissipating after a 10-second duration, after ricocheting off solid blocks three separate times, or immediately upon contact with water or lava. <a className='underline'>The Bee Gun has a 1/3 (33.33%) chance of being dropped by the Queen Bee.</a>

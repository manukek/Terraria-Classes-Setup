Each shot fires three arrows with an additional 1/3 (33.33%) chance to spawn one extra arrow (one less arrow while using Holy, Unholy, Hellfire, or Jesters Arrows), while only consuming a single arrow from the players inventory. The arrows fall in a wide spread towards the area where the cursor was pointed. The Daedalus Stormbow has a 1/4 (25%) chance of being dropped by Hallowed Mimics.

Its best modifier is Unreal.</h1>

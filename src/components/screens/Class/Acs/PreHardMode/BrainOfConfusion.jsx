        <h1 className=""><a className='font-bold'>The Brain of Confusion</a> is a pre-Hardmode accessory that, upon taking damage while equipped, nearby enemies have a 3/5 (60%) chance of receiving the Confused debuff for at minimum 1.5 seconds. The chance, duration, and area of effect of the debuff are based on the amount of damage taken.

Furthermore, the player wielding it has a 1/6 (16.67%) chance of dodging an attack, which inflicts the Cerebral Mindtrick debuff on them for four seconds. Despite being a debuff, it increases critical strike chance and summon damage by 10%.[1] While the debuff is active, the player cannot dodge another attack. <a className='underline font-bold'>The Brain of Confusion is always dropped from the Brain of Cthulhus Treasure Bag in Expert Mode.</a></h1>

The projectile moves up and down in a randomized zig-zag pattern horizontally, but not vertically (traveling straight when shooting directly up or down). <a className='underline'>The Thunder Zapper can be found in Sandstone Chests in the lower 3/7ths of the Underground Desert and in Oasis Crates and Mirage Crates obtained from fishing in the Oasis.</a>
